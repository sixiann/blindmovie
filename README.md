# Blind Date with a Movie

üçø Inspired by [Blind Date with a Book](https://blinddatewithabook.org/). It‚Äôs like a regular blind date where you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting until you get there. But, with movies! üé•

Blind Date with a Movie is a Flask application that displays some random movies with blind date descriptions. When you click on a description, it reveals a link to the movie. The blind date descriptions are generated using the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5), and the movies are sourced from the TMDB API.
